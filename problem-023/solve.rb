# A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number.
# For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
#
# A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
#
# As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as
# the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater
# than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced
# any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two
# abundant numbers is less than this limit.
#
# Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
